## Code-Based Digital Project: The Pill 

### Description
Your own personal journey in navigating the somewhat convoluted pharm industry and mental health. 

### Prompt
In this project, guided by the things you are learning in your coding experiments, our readings and conversations, and beyond, you are going to produce a digital text designed to explore or advocate for a position on an issue that is relevant and important to you.

You will use thorough research to contextualize and present the current state of an issue, overview the conversations that currently situate that issue, and present an argument as to what needs to be done to make things better, help us move forward, advance the conversation, etc. Your target issue might be as simple as a conversation in a community you’re a part of, or it might be something more complex, like an issue in your career, a policy decision, or a cause you’re personally passionate about. Whatever your choice, it should be a chance for you to thoroughly understand and contextualize an issue, as well as develop your own skills in coding and composition as you create something new in a particular digital genre. Your project should represent an amount of content and work roughly equal to a 2,000-word research paper, and should have at least eight cited sources.
